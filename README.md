# triviaGame

This is a Sailor Moon trivia game created for our fifth homework assignment.  It was built using javascript and jquery with minimal html; most was inserted using jQuery.

I built this primarily using for loops which allows for the game to be scaled up.  It would just need more questions added to the question/answer bank which is contained in the object.
