<h1>Trivia Game</h1>

This is a Sailor Moon trivia game created for our fifth homework assignment.  It was built using javascript and jquery with minimal html; most was inserted using jQuery.

I built this primarily using for loops which allows for the game to be scaled up.  It would just need more questions added to the question/answer bank which is contained in the object.

<h2>To Play</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Click Start Game to reveal the questions and timer</li>
  <li>Select answers to each question -- a timer of 45 seconds is set.</li>
  <li>After the 45 seconds have expired, the questions are removed and the number of questions right and wrong are listed</li>
